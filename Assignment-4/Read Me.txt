Create script called getngrams.py. 

Your script should define the following function:

processSentence(sentence,posLex,negLex,tagger,c):  The parameters of this function are a sentence (a string), a set positive words, a set of negative words, a POS tagger, and a character c.  The function should return 

a list with all the n-grams in the sentence that have the following structure:                                                   

not <any word> <ADV?> <pos/neg word> <NOUN(c)>. 

The symbol <ADV?> means "an adverb or nothing"

The symbol <NOUN(c)> means "a noun that includes the character c" 

For example if c=='e', the following sentences would match:

-  not a very good idea

 

- not a good idea

The following sentences would not match:

- not  always a  good  idea   (it doesn't match because 'a' is not an adverb).

-  not a very good car  (it doesn't match because there is no 'e' in 'car')

 

Notes:

Don't change the names or the parameters of the function
Make sure that your script imports all the libraries needed by the function
When you look for the character c, make sure to ignore case. For example, if c=='f', then both 'food' and 'Food' should match.
