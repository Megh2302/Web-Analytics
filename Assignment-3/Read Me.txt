- Create a script named scraper.py 

- Your script should define the following functions:

def getCritic(review): finds and returns the name of the critic from the given review object.


def getRating(review):  finds and returns the rating from the given review object. The return value should be 'rotten' ,  'fresh', or 'NA' if the review doesn't have a rating.

 

def getSource(review):  finds and returns the source (e.g 'New York Daily News') of the review from the given review object. The return value should be 'NA' if the review doesn't have a source.

 

def getDate(review):  finds and returns the date of the review from the given review object. The return value should be  'NA' if the review doesn't have a date.


def getTextLen(review):  finds and returns the number of characters in the text of the review from the given review object. The return value should 'NA' if the review doesn't have text. You don't have to strip() or process the text in any other way before computing the length.

 

Notes:- Your script will be used to extract the critic, rating, source, date, and text length of 20 reviewers from a page of reviews on RottenTomatoes.
