Write a script called senticounter.py. Define a function run() inside senticounter.py.

The function should:

- Accept as a parameter the path to a text file. The text file has one review per line. 

- Read the list of positive words from the positive-words.txt file.

- Read the list of negative words from the negative-words.txt file.

- We define a NO-NEG review to be a review that includes no negative words. Create a dictionary that includes one key for each positive word that appears in the input text file. The dictionary should map each of these positive words to the number of NO-NEG reviews that include it.

 For example, if the word "great" appears in 5 NO-NEG reviews, then the dictionary should map the key "great" to the value 5. 

- Return the dictionary 

Notes: Ignore case. You can also assume that the input file includes only letters, no punctuation or other special characters.
